# Custom C Library

This is a library of functions that I commonly use. I've always had to rewrite these when I start a new project, so I decided to collect them all store them in a single place. 

**NOTE**: These aren't designed to be the most efficient versions. These are meant to have better error handling and be convenient to use. If efficiency was a concern, you should be writing problem specific functions anyway. 

If you find something that's wrong with a function, please let me know.

Feel free to fork this and create your own library.

## Contents

##### fileio

A library of file IO operations that I commonly perform. This would include things like `read_line` and `read_lines` which can read a line or read an array of lines from a file or `stdin`.

##### str\_funcs

This library of string functions that are usually avail in languages like java or python, such as `is_substring` or `index_of`.
